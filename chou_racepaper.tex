\begin{abstract}
The rapid growth in popularity of machine learning and data mining to determine social outcomes -- such as in healthcare, evidence-based sentencing, and credit assessment shows great potential, but presents many technical and ethical challenges. In particular, the analysis of race and ethnicity, either as a variable or by proxy, can be prone to profiling and discrimination. This paper aims to provoke new directions in approaching and re-approaching such data. Areas of challenge present themselves along the entire pipeline, including in the acquisition of biased datasets, feature and class selection for algorithmic classification and segmentation, and the application of results with accountability.  Additionally, I discuss potential for computational solutions, both in monitoring existing software and detecting discrimination from datasets. I advocate for the treatment of race as a mutable social variable, and subsequent redesign of algorithms.

\section{Introduction}
Fill this out with stuff.

\section{The {\secit Body} of The Paper}
Typically, the body of a paper is organized
into a hierarchical structure, with numbered or unnumbered
headings for sections, subsections, sub-subsections, and even
smaller sections.  The command \texttt{{\char'134}section} that
precedes this paragraph is part of such a
hierarchy.\footnote{This is the second footnote.  It
starts a series of three footnotes that add nothing
informational, but just give an idea of how footnotes work
and look. It is a wordy one, just so you see
how a longish one plays out.} \LaTeX\ handles the numbering
and placement of these headings for you, when you use
the appropriate heading commands around the titles
of the headings.  If you want a sub-subsection or
smaller part to be unnumbered in your output, simply append an
asterisk to the command name.  Examples of both
numbered and unnumbered headings will appear throughout the
balance of this sample document.

Because the entire article is contained in
the \textbf{document} environment, you can indicate the
start of a new paragraph with a blank line in your
input file; that is why this sentence forms a separate paragraph.

\section{A Brief Definition of Data Mining}
With the growing availability of large datasets, there has been an increased interest in data-driven methods of analysis and prediction. The terms ``data science", ``data mining", ``data analytics", and ``machine learning" are often used interchangeably, and with confusion, to target similar problems. 

To make a distinction, I will refer to data science as the broader umbrella concept, “the set of activities involved in transforming collected data into valuable insights, products, or solutions” [Cite DDS]; machine learning as the field of computer science that focuses on improving pattern recognition and prediction; data mining as the specific application of existing machine learning techniques to better understand and manipulate specific datasets, and data analytics as the business-facing aspects of the above.

In this paper, I choose to focus on data mining, for the key reason that it emphasizes choice of data and applications, which can have a great effect on potentially discriminatory results, even when using the same methods in machine learning to perform the analysis with. However, areas of challenge and redesign are relevant to all related fields.


\section{The Popular Account of Race}

Race, also a term that seems to expand and shrink in scope depending on context, is far trickier to define. Because it is deeply socially ingrained, race has the unfortunate quality of being viewed as intuitive, yet quickly reveals itself impossible to define. Conceptions of race generally boil down into two camps: essentialist versus constructivist perspectives.

Common societal perceptions of race view it as a fixed and immutable variable. Although discussions have broadened in recent years, by and large it is considered a descriptive, rather than prescriptive term. A person is assigned a racial category before birth, chosen from a number of set possible classes, which remains constant throughout their entire life. This is known as an essentialist or primordialist notion of race, also deemed by philosopher Lawrence Blum as the “popular account”. Notably, it is distinct from other large-scale human groupings, such as ethnicity and nationality, which are viewed as cultivated (98). A main contributor to this notion of race is the fact that it includes physical or biological “markers”, traits that are prone to genetic explanation (although not necessarily so).

Social constructionists view race (along with other labels, such as gender) in a less deterministic way. Instead, it is seen as a category constructed and shaped by existing social structures. Race, therefore, is neither biologically nor genetically justified. It is contextually dependent on time, place, and social surrounding. Key to a constructionist view is the fact that race is not necessarily consistent.  

\section{Related Work}
In “Race as a ‘Bundle of Sticks’: Designs that Estimate Effects of Seemingly Immutable Characteristics”, Harvard researchers Sen and Wasow address current limitations of studying race in the field of political science.  Treating race as an immutable, pre-assigned trait limits experimental design— since the variable is determined before birth, considering other effects post-birth risks introducing post-treatment bias, making studies of race difficult [Sen 2]. As a solution, Sen and Wasow suggest examining questions involving race in a more constructivist framework— understanding it as a composite variable (“bundle of sticks”) so that each aspect may be examined separately in experiment for estimating casual inference [?].

Data mining faces similar issues in considering race as an immutable variable, challenges that compound when applying results to make predictions based on race. Although predictive algorithms are not necessarily concerned with determining causal links, they are concerned with inference at large— and more importantly, applications. In this paper, I expand on some of the issues specific to data mining in treating race as a static variable.

Big Data’s Disparate Impact, a survey by Barocas and Selbst, examines how existing practices in data mining are prone to discrimination, focusing on legal implications and difficulties with legislation [Cite]. Here, I choose to highlight how changes in  algorithmic design can lead to positive effect— focusing on the power of norms ahead of the law [Lessig].

Finally, there exists a small (but growing!) group of publications within the computational community criticizing popular techniques for demographic segmentation and inference. I highlight a few of these papers as examples for improvement.


\section{Vision and Problem Statement}
In this paper I propose a shift in the data mining and machine learning community to treat race as a socially constructed variable, instead of one that is static and immutable. Existing methods of labeling race as such can be prone to stereotyping and profiling, and when applied to social applications, can have unwanted discriminatory effects. Reconsideration of the way race is examined in data, and how it is presented in results opens up new avenues for creativity without discounting existing techniques.

This consideration is both more experimentally responsible and scientifically sound. Regardless of personal philosophy, it is more appropriate to treat race in a constructionist sense when dealing with data mining, since it is, by definition, the mining of observed behaviors within a social context.  

Accuracy suffers when behaviors that shift depending on social context are used as a proxy for variables seen as immutable and static. Moreover, harmful racial stereotyping and profiling may occur with the application of such algorithms. In the following, I will outline challenge areas in analyzing (and predicting) with racial data, suggesting examples contrary to the common practice that show improved results, and shine light on the potential for algorithmic and societal accountability through data mining.

\subsection{Citations}
Citations to articles \cite{bowman:reasoning,
clark:pct, braams:babel, herlihy:methodology},
conference proceedings \cite{clark:pct} or
books \cite{salas:calculus, Lamport:LaTeX} listed
in the Bibliography section of your
article will occur throughout the text of your article.
You should use BibTeX to automatically produce this bibliography;
you simply need to insert one of several citation commands with
a key of the item cited in the proper location in
the \texttt{.tex} file \cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.
The key is a short reference you invent to uniquely
identify each work; in this sample document, the key is
the first author's surname and a
word from the title.  This identifying key is included
with each item in the \texttt{.bib} file for your article.

The details of the construction of the \texttt{.bib} file
are beyond the scope of this sample document, but more
information can be found in the \textit{Author's Guide},
and exhaustive details in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's
Guide}\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

This article shows only the plainest form
of the citation command, using \texttt{{\char'134}cite}.
This is what is stipulated in the SIGS style specifications.
No other citation format is endorsed or supported.

\subsection{Tables}
Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best
placement for them is typically the top of the page
nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go
in the \textbf{tabular} environment, to
be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired
horizontal and vertical rules.  Again, detailed instructions
on \textbf{tabular} material
is found in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table 1 is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed
dvi output of this document.

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\ \hline
\O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\ \hline
$\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\ \hline
\$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\ \hline
$\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
\hline\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of
the page's live area, use the environment
\textbf{table*} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this wide
table will ``float" to a location deemed more desirable.
Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table 2 is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the
table here with the table in the printed dvi
output of this document.

\texttt{{\char'134}numberofauthors}& 200& Author enumeration\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\ \hline\end{tabular}
\end{table*}
% end the environment with {table*}, NOTE not {table}!

\subsection{Figures}
Like tables, figures cannot be split across pages; the
best placement for them
is typically the top or the bottom of the page nearest
their initial cite.  To ensure this proper ``floating'' placement
of figures, use the environment
\textbf{figure} to enclose the figure and its caption.

This sample document contains examples of \textbf{.eps}
and \textbf{.ps} files to be displayable with \LaTeX.  More
details on each of these is found in the \textit{Author's Guide}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\epsfig{file=fly.eps}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic (.eps format).}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\epsfig{file=fly.eps, height=1in, width=1in}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic (.eps format)
that has been resized with the \texttt{epsfig} command.}
\end{figure}


As was the case with tables, you may want a figure
that spans two columns.  To do this, and still to
ensure proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the environment
\textbf{figure*} to enclose the figure and its caption.
and don't forget to end the environment with
{figure*}, not {figure}!

\begin{figure*}
\centering
\epsfig{file=flies.eps}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic (.eps format)
that needs to span two columns of text.}
\end{figure*}

Note that either {\textbf{.ps}} or {\textbf{.eps}} formats are
used; use
the \texttt{{\char'134}epsfig} or \texttt{{\char'134}psfig}
commands as appropriate for the different file types.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\psfig{file=rosette.ps, height=1in, width=1in,}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic (.ps format) that has
been resized with the \texttt{psfig} command.}
\vskip -6pt
\end{figure}

\subsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
Other common constructs that may occur in your article are
the forms for logical constructs like theorems, axioms,
corollaries and proofs.  There are
two forms, one produced by the
command \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} and the
other by the command \texttt{{\char'134}newdef}; perhaps
the clearest and easiest way to distinguish them is
to compare the two in the output of this sample document:

This uses the \textbf{theorem} environment, created by
the\linebreak\texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} command:
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
\begin{theorem}
Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$.  If $G$ is
an antiderivative for $f$ on $[a,b]$, then
\begin{displaymath}\int^b_af(t)dt = G(b) - G(a).\end{displaymath}
\end{theorem}

The other uses the \textbf{definition} environment, created
by the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command:
\newdef{definition}{Definition}
\begin{definition}
If $z$ is irrational, then by $e^z$ we mean the
unique number which has
logarithm $z$: \begin{displaymath}{\log e^z = z}\end{displaymath}
\end{definition}

Two lists of constructs that use one of these
forms is given in the
\textit{Author's  Guidelines}.
 
There is one other similar construct environment, which is
already set up
for you; i.e. you must \textit{not} use
a \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to
create it: the \textbf{proof} environment.  Here
is a example of its use:
\begin{proof}
Suppose on the contrary there exists a real number $L$ such that
\begin{displaymath}
\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L.
\end{displaymath}
Then
\begin{displaymath}
l=\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x)
= \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\left[ g{x} \cdot \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right ]
= \lim_{x\rightarrow c} g(x) \cdot \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0\cdot L = 0,
\end{displaymath}
which contradicts our assumption that $l\neq 0$.
\end{proof}

Complete rules about using these environments and using the
two different creation commands are in the
\textit{Author's Guide}; please consult it for more
detailed instructions.  If you need to use another construct,
not listed therein, which you want to have the same
formatting as the Theorem
or the Definition\cite{salas:calculus} shown above,
use the \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} or the
\texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command,
respectively, to create it.

\subsection*{A {\secit Caveat} for the \TeX\ Expert}
Because you have just been given permission to
use the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to create a
new form, you might think you can
use \TeX's \texttt{{\char'134}def} to create a
new command: \textit{Please refrain from doing this!}
Remember that your \LaTeX\ source code is primarily intended
to create camera-ready copy, but may be converted
to other forms -- e.g. HTML. If you inadvertently omit
some or all of the \texttt{{\char'134}def}s recompilation will
be, to say the least, problematic.

\section{Conclusions}
This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.
Remember that you might still have Acknowledgments or
Appendices; brief samples of these
follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and
we will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception
of the reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in
this paper are to articles which have nothing to
do with the present subject and are used as
examples only.

\section{Headings in Appendices}
The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for
the body of the article are different in the appendices.
In the \textbf{appendix} environment, the command
\textbf{section} is used to
indicate the start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order
designation (i.e. the first is A, the second B, etc.) and
a title (if you include one).  So, if you need
hierarchical structure
\textit{within} an Appendix, start with \textbf{subsection} as the
highest level. Here is an outline of the body of this
